# Project Solution

This is the solution for my project. Currently there are two projects

* [Algorithms](https://github.com/PizzaServices/Algorithms/tree/master/Algorithms/Algorithms):

   This project contains all the algorithms implementations. At the moment it targets `.net-core 3.1` with `C#` version `8.0`. Also there are `nullable reference types` enabled. But currently not all implementation make use of this feature but it´s work in progress.

* [AlgorithmsTest](https://github.com/PizzaServices/Algorithms/tree/master/Algorithms/AlgorithmsTest) 

   This project contains all the unit tests for the algorithms. At the moment it targets `.net-core 3.1` with `C#` version `8.0`. I use `NUnit` with version `3.12.0` as testframework. At the moment not all algorithms are tested. But I´m working on it.
